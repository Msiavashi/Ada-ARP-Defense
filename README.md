# Ada-ARP-Defense
Ada is a very simple tool written in pure ruby and on top of packetfu to detect arp poisoned packets and defend you automatically from the attack while even find the attacker for you . basicly its a simple arp spoof defender .
for now the tool is really simple but i'll keep improving it for sure .
